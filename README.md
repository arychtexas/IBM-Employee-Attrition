# IBM-Employee-Attrition

  IBM Data Scientists created a fictional data set exploring employee attrition. In this data set, we will explore, define and solve a series of factors that may or may not be attributed to employee attrition at IBM. 

  We will also compare and contrast the former workers with the other employees.  Eventually, we will categorize the former and current employees into three groups: Category Green: Retained, Category Yellow: At-Risk, and Category Red: Attrited.  We will also create a trial data set to determine if we can retain "at-risk" employees based on the data provided.
